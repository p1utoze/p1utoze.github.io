        <p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adithya-awati-87b7541a3/" target="_blank">Adithya Awati</a>, and I love training models, playing around with knobs of deep learning and <a href="https://github.com/p1utoze" target="_blank">contributing to open source</a>. I began my journey in 2019 during
            the COVID lockdown, starting with Python and C++ and creating small projects. Running into multiple errors on Windows (yes, the blue screen of death), I learned about Linux and shifted to my first distro- Mint. Since then I quickly gained a strong understanding of
            the system, using it majorly for all my development activities, and ultimately fell in love with OSS.
            <br>
            I then ventured into building mini-projects with basic HTML, CSS, and JS. Not really liking the Frontend dev side, I changed my gears to backend development spending my time as a script kiddie. I learned Python and C and showcased my skills
            by securing the top 5 positions twice in Coding Contests at my university. I delved more into Desktop development from tkinter to QT building a simple birthday reminder application. 
            <br>
            I switched my next gear to explore statistics and mathematics like Linear algebra, the probability for machine learning, and building Time series models for agricultural yield prediction securing 3rd place in the Diffuse AI hacakthon. I began building applications over SQL databases like MariaDB, PostgresSQL and eventually built a Unified data portal for the Police Hackathon securing under top 10 position.
            <br>
            Currently, I am sharpening my skills in NLP, developing advanced Recommender System models, learning about Reinforcement learning, and delving into HMI plugins and SCADA systems. I have successfully completed a semester in Quantum Computing learning about Qubits, Gates, Multi-qubit circuits, and building
            applications with diverse use cases. I am driven by my passion for deploying AI and actively seeking exciting
            full-time opportunities in the field. As a person who loves free stuff, I have spent a lot of time researching for open-source softwares to deploy and host my Deep learning models serving with FastAPI. I love challenges and debugging errors from the kernel level to the application level. <a href="mailto:aditya.n.awati@gmail.com">Feel free to reach out to me</a> through my inbox for networking and
